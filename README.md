# Sunshine Advanced

## Version History :package:

**latest** 	Nothing here yet. :grin:

This repo tries its best to follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

## Introduction :point_up:

This repository holds an implementation of the Sunshine app created during [Udacity](udacity.com)'s [Advanced Android App Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855) online class.

The app fetches weather from the net and shows it on phone or tab.

## How To Use :wrench:

:zero: Install the app and run it. :smile:

:one: Here is how the app looks on phone.

**Phones: The Home Screen**

**Phones: The Details Screen**

:two: And here is how it looks on (10-inch) tablets.

**(10-inch) Tabs: The Home and Details Screens**

## How It Works

This section will be updated in time (from today Saturday, 28. January 2017 05:39PM).

## Abilities :muscle:

* Fetches weather data online (specifically from [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.com)), stores it in phone memory, and displays it to the user.
* Allows the user to change his/her location to see the location's weather.

## Limitations :worried:

* The app does not provide hourly updates of weather. 
* The app cannot take a selfie (he he).

## Possible Future Work :fast_forward:

- [ ] Improve UI in 7-inch tabs.

- [ ] Improve the naming of days in the home screen.

## Other things :books:

* Much gratitude to the patient people at Udacity. Couldn't have learnt a thing without them. 

* Thanks to OpenWeatherMap for a robust weather API.
